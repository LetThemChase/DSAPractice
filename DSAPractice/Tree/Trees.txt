1. Binary Tree : 1 max 2 chidren
2. Full BT: 0 or 2 chidren
3. Complete BT : All level completely filled except last level. Last level have nodes as left as possible.
4. Perfect BT : All leaf noodes at same level.
5. Balanced BT : Height is max log 2 (n) . 
6. Degenerate BT : Skew tree. Every node have only 1 child.


Balanced BT : 

1. Height is max log 2 (n). 
2. Math.Abs( left height - right height) <= 1

How to check : In height Return -1 if not balanced.
